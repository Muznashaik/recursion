class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        if n == 0:
            return 1.0
        elif n < 0:
            return 1 / self.myPow(x, -n)
        else:
            y = self.myPow(x, n // 2)
            if n % 2 == 0:
                return y * y
            else:
                return y * y * x
                The method myPow takes two parameters: x (a float) and n (an integer), and it returns a float representing x raised to the power of n.
In the first if statement, the method checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, the method returns 1.0, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
In the elif block, if n is negative, the method takes the reciprocal of the result of myPow(x, -n) and returns it. This is because x raised to the power of a negative n is equivalent to 1 divided by x raised to the power of -n.
In the else block, when n is positive, the method calculates half as the result of myPow(x, n // 2). This is done to optimize the calculation by avoiding redundant computations when n is large.
Next, the method checks if n is even by using the modulo operator (%). If n is even, the method returns half * half, which is equivalent to x raised to the power of n.
If n is odd, the method returns half * half * x, which is equivalent to x raised to the power of n.
